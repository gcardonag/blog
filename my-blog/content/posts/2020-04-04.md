After being asked about the AD<->IAM SAML flow, I realized I was pretty lost on how to explain exactly how it works. I thought I got the general idea: trust established via the shared metadata and the SAML flow, but I didn't understand how IAM roles magically mapped to AD groups, as that task was always done before my involvement in any AWS work.

You can go about it two ways:
AD <- AWS (pull)

    Note right of AD: Non-MS User<br />(Didn't work in<br />Demo)
    User->>AD: Login
    AD->>User: Share assigned roles
    User->>IAM: Login
```
