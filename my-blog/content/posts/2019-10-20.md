Trials and Tribulations:
- When creating a blog with Gatsby and setting up the gatsby-plugin-s3 tool, make sure that the acl is set to null and also rerun `gatsby-plugin-s3 deploy` (or any command that targets it). It seems that the permissions are baked into the build process somehow. (TODO: How???)
