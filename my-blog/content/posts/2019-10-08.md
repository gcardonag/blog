When using Athena's JDBC driver in a Java project with other AWS libraries, you may face some conflicts with 
libraries in the com.amazonaws.auth package. If you do, use a tool like 7zip to open the JDBC driver JAR and 
remove that package. That should remove the conflict and force the JDBC driver to use the imported core aws lib instead.

I did try shading the package via Maven but that did not work.
